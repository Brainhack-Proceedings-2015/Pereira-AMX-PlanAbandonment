\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}

Task-based fMRI is an interesting approach for understand brain
processes for a given task. However, fMRI images are usually
preprocessed hours, or even days, after the scan. During preprocessing
stage, defects in images are detected and, in some cases, can not be
corrected. For example, technical problems or lack of collaboration from
the subject to realize the given tasks. For this cases, it is necessary
to realize a new scan.

\section{Approach}\label{approach}

In this BrainHack project, we aim to detect if the subject is following
the given task and give an almost real-time feedback to the researchers
make decisions (e.g.~restart the task), to avoid images discard or
rescans. To do so, we use Automated Planning techniques
\cite{Sukthankar2014}, a sub-area of Artificial Intelligence. For a
given fMRI paradigm, a plan should be created and compared with the
subject's brain activations during the scan using recognition methods.
To use plan recognition methods, we need to discretize and formalize the
fMRI and construct a expected plan based on the hypothesis paradigm
using this formalization. To evaluate the pursuance of a specific
paradigm, we aim to use real-time fMRI method to retrieve BOLD signals
of brain regions that are supposed to be active in a particular time
range. By doing so, it is possible to detect if a subject is following
the paradigm given a specific stimulus type, such as visual or auditory
stimulus. The brain state of each stimulus type will be mapped based on
atlas literature. For example, Brodmann areas 17, 18 and 19 will be
mapped to cover visual stimulus with a state \emph{visual\_actv}. So,
for a paradigm that works with visual stimuli, the plan must contain
\emph{visual\_actv} for the given time that the stimulus occurs.

\section{Discussion}\label{discussion}

The formalization of brain states highly depends on the discretization
of specific region states, which might vary for each subject. In order
to normalize the signals, a previous tunning phase is required with
simple paradigms, depending on which paradigm will be executed. The
usage of real-time fMRI methods aggregates to our approach since the
tunning and pursuance recognition can be made during the exam. In the
case of fMRI paradigm abandonment, the paradigm can be adapted to induce
or interest the subject in a way that the subject proceeds with its
tasks, using methods such as demonstrated by \cite{Dongha2011}.

\section{Conclusions}\label{conclusions}

This project is in its initial phase. Real-time fMRI methods are being
tested, using AFNI's provided tools. The next step is to formalize basic
stimuli types based on mapped regions. By using these formalizations,
paradigms can be converted to plans and it become possible to evaluate
the participation of a subject during the scan.
